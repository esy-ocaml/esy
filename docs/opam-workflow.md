esy supports developing opam projects directly, the workflow is similar to esy
projects:

```bash
% git clone https://github.com/rgrinberg/ocaml-semver.git
% cd ocaml-semver
% esy install
% esy build
```

## Installing dependencies

To install project dependencies run `esy install` command.

This will read dependencies from all `*.opam` files found in a project and
install them locally into the sandbox.

Note that even compiler is installed locally to the project, you don't need to
manage switches manually like in opam:

```
% esy ocamlc
```

Will run the compiler version defined by the project's constraints set in
`*.opam` files.

## Building project

To build project dependencies and the project itself run `esy build` command.

The `esy build` command  performs differently depending on the number of opam
files found in a project directory:

- In case there's a single `*.opam` file found `esy build` will build all
  dependencies and then execute `build` commands found in opam metadata.

- In case there are multiple `*.opam` files found `esy build` will build all
  dependencies and stop. To build the project itself users are supposed to use the
  command which is specified by the project's workflow but run inside the esy's
  build environment.

  In case of a dune-based project this is usually means:

  ```bash
  % esy b dune build
  ```
