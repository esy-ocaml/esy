Esy provides a single command called `esy`.

The typical workflow is to `cd` into a directory that contains a `package.json`
file, and then perform operations on that project.

There are example projects:

- [hello-reason](https://github.com/esy-ocaml/hello-reason), an example Reason
  project which uses [dune][] build system.
- [hello-ocaml](https://github.com/esy-ocaml/hello-ocaml), an example OCaml
  project which uses [dune][] build system.

The typical workflow looks like this:

0.  Install esy:

    ```bash
    npm install -g esy
    ```

    If you had installed esy previously:

    ```bash
    npm uninstall --global --update esy
    ```

1.  Clone the project:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:esy-ocaml/esy-ocaml-project.git
    cd esy-ocaml-project
    ```

1.  Install project's dependencies source code and perform an initial build of the project's dependencies and of the project itself:

    ```bash
    esy
    ```

1.  Test the compiled executables inside the project's environment:

    ```bash
    esy ./_build/default/bin/hello.exe
    ```

1.  Hack on project's source code and rebuild the project:

    ```bash
    esy build
    ```

Also:

6.  It is possible to invoke any command from within the project's sandbox.
    For example build & run tests with:

    ```shell
    esy make test
    ```

    You can run any command inside the project environment by just
    prefixing it with `esy`:

    ```bash
    esy <anycommand>
    ```

7.  To shell into the project's sandbox:

    ```bash
    esy shell
    ```

8.  For more options:

    ```bash
    esy help
    ```
