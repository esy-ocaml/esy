 * Order of operations:
 * - solve for real deps of the main module
 * - [list of solved deps], [list of build deps requests for MAIN]
 * - can look in the manifest cache for build deps of the solved deps
 *
 * - now I want to dedup where possible, so I'm installing the minimum amount of build deps
 * - now I have a list of list((name, list(realVersion))) that is the versions of the build deps to install
 * - for each of those, do `solveDeps(cache, depsOfThatOneRealVersion)`
 *   - build deps aren't allowed to depend on each other I don't think
 * - that will result in new buildDeps needed
 * - churn until we're done
 *
 * - when making the lockfile, for each build dep that a thing wants, find one that we've chosen, whichever is most recent probably

/* TODO need to figure out how to specify what deps we're interested in.
 *
 * Maybe a fn: Types.depsByKind => List(Types.dep)
 *
 * orr maybe we don't? Maybe
 *
 * do we just care about runtime deps?
 * Do we care about runtime deps being the same as build deps?
 * kindof, a little. But how do we enforce that?
 * How do we do that.
 * Do we care about runtime deps of our build deps being the same as runtime deps of our other build deps?
 *
 * whaaat rabbit hole is this even.
 *
 * What are the initial constraints?
 *
 * For runtime:
 * - so easy, just bring it all in, require uniqueness, ignoring dev deps at every step
 * - if there's already a lockfile, then mark those ones as already installed and do "-changed,-notuptodate"
 *
 * For [target]:
 * - do essentially the same thing -- include current installs, try to have minimal changes
 *
 * For build:
 * - all of those runtime deps we got, figure out what build deps they want
 * - loop until our "pending build deps" list is done
 *   - filter out all build dep reqs that are already satisfied by packages we've already downloaded
 *   - run a unique query that doesn't do any transitives - just deduping build requirements
 *   - if that fails, fallback to a non-unique query
 *   - now that we know which build deps we want to install, loop through each one
 *     - for its runtime deps, do a unique with -changed, including all currently installed packages
 *     - collect all transitive build deps, add them to the list of build deps to get
 *
 *
 *
 * For npm:
 * - this is the last step -- npm deps can't loop back to runtime or build deps
 * - it's easy, because they're all runtime deps. We're solid, just run with it.
 * - first do a pass with uniqueness
 * - if it doesn't work, do a pass without uniqueness, and then post-process to remove duplicates where possible
