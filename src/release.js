/**
 * Implementation of `esy release` process.
 *
 * Release types:
 *
 * **dev**: Dev releases perform everything on the client installer machine
 * (download, build).
 *
 * **pack**: Pack releases perform download and "pack"ing on the "server", and
 * then only builds will be performed on the client. This snapshots a giant
 * tarball of all dependencies' source files into the release.
 *
 * **bin**: Bin releases perform everything on "the server", and "the client"
 * installs a package consisting only of binary executables.
 *

 *
 * For 'bin' releases, it doesn't make sense to use any build cache, so the `Makefile`
 * at the root of this project substitutes placeholders in the generated binary
 * wrappers indicating where the build cache should be.
 *
 * > Relocating: "But aren't binaries built with particular paths encoded? How do
 * we distribute binaries that were built on someone else's machine?"
 *
 * That's one of the main challenges with distributing binaries. But most
 * applications that assume hard coded paths also allow overriding that hard
 * coded-ness in a wrapper script.  (Merlin, ocamlfind, and many more). Thankfully
 * we can have binary releases wrap the intended binaries that not only makes
 * Windows compatibility easier, but that also fixes many of the problems of
 * relocatability.
 *
 * > NOTE: Many binary npm releases include binary wrappers that correctly resolve
 * > the binary depending on platform, but they use a node.js script wrapper. The
 * > problem with this is that it can *massively* slow down build times when your
 * > builds call out to your binary which must first boot an entire V8 runtime. For
 * > `reason-cli` binary releases, we create lighter weight shell scripts that load
 * > in a fraction of the time of a V8 environment.
 *
 * The binary wrapper is generally helpful whether or *not* you are using
 * prereleased binaries vs. compiling from source, and whether or not you are
 * targeting linux/osx vs. Windows.
 *
 * When using Windows:
 *   - The wrapper script allows your linux and osx builds to produce
 *     `executableName.exe` files while still allowing your windows builds to
 *     produce `executableName.exe` as well.  It's usually a good idea to name all
 *     your executables `.exe` regardless of platform, but npm gets in the way
 *     there because you can't have *three* binaries named `executableName.exe`
 *     all installed upon `npm install -g`. Wrapper scripts to the rescue.  We
 *     publish two script wrappers per exposed binary - one called
 *     `executableName` (a shell script that works on Mac/Linux) and one called
 *     `executableName.cmd` (Windows cmd script) and npm will ensure that both are
 *     installed globally installed into the PATH when doing `npm install -g`, but
 *     in windows command line, `executableName` will resolve to the `.cmd` file.
 *     The wrapper script will execute the *correct* binary for the platform.
 * When using binaries:
 *   - The wrapper script will typically make *relocated* binaries more reliable.
 * When building pack or dev releases:
 *   - Binaries do not exist at the time the packages are installed (they are
 *     built in postinstall), but npm requires that bin links exists *at the time*
 *     of installation. Having a wrapper script allows you to publish `npm`
 *     packages that build binaries, where those binaries do not yet exist, yet
 *     have all the bin links installed correctly at install time.
 *
 * The wrapper scripts are common practice in npm packaging of binaries, and each
 * kind of release/development benefits from those wrappers in some way.
 *
 * TODO:
 *  - Support local installations of <package_name> which would work for any of
 *    the three release forms.
 *    - With the wrapper script, it might already even work.
 *  - Actually create `.cmd` launcher.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 *  We maintain two global variables that wrappers consult:
 *
 *  - `<PACKAGE_NAME>_ENVIRONMENT_SOURCED`: So that if one wrapped binary calls
 *    out to another we don't need to repeatedly setup the path.
 *
 *  - `<PACKAGE_NAME>_ENVIRONMENT_SOURCED_<binary_name>`: So that if
 *    `<binary_name>` ever calls out to the same `<binary_name>` script we know
 *    it's because the environment wasn't sourced correctly and therefore it is
 *    infinitely looping.  An early check detects this.
 *
 *  Only if we even need to compute the environment will we do the expensive work
 *  of sourcing the paths. That makes it so merlin can repeatedly call
 *  `<binary_name>` with very low overhead for example.
 *
 *  If the env didn't correctly load and no `<binary_name>` shadows it, this will
 *  infinitely loop. Therefore, we put a check to make sure that no
 *  `<binary_name>` calls out to ocaml again. See
 *  `<PACKAGE_NAME>_ENVIRONMENT_SOURCED_<binary_name>`
