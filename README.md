## Workflow

To make changes to `esy` and test them locally:

```
% git clone git://github.com/esy/esy.git
% cd esy
% make bootstrap
```

Run:

```
% make
```

to see the description of development workflow.

### Running Tests

```
% make test
```

### Branches

There are two branches:

- `master` — the active development, we cut new versions out of there regularly.
- `0.0.x` — maintainance branch for 0.0.x releases.

### Issues

Issues are tracked at [esy/esy][].

### Publishing Releases

esy is released on npm.

Because esy is written in OCaml/Reason and compiled into a native executable we
need to acquire a set of prebuilt binaries. We employ CI servers (thanks Travis
CI) to build platform specific releases.

The release workflow is the following:

1.  Ensure you arre on `master` branch and run

    ```
    % make bump-patch-verson
    % git push && git push --tags
    ```

    (this bumps patch version, use `bump-minor-version` or `bump-major-version`
    correspondingly to bump either minor or major version of esy)

2.  Wait till CI finishes its task and uploads releases on GitHub,
    check https://github.com/esy/esy/releases for them.

3.  Run

    ```
    % make release
    ```

    Which downloads platform specific releases (which CI uploaded GitHub) and
    produces an npm releases with needed metadata inside `_release` directory.

4.  Ensure release inside `_release` directory is ok.

    You can `cd _release && npm pack && npm install -g ./esy-*.tgz` to test how
    release installs and feels.

5.  Run `cd _release && npm publish` to publish release on npm.

    Release tag `next` is used to publish preview releases.
