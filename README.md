## Repository structure

- `esy-build-package` — source code for `esy-build-package` command
- `esy` — source code for `esy` core commands
- `esy-install` — source code for `esy install`, `esy add` and other yarn-based
  command.
  - `esy-install/esy-install` — this is a submodule which points to
    `esy/esy-install` repo, a fork of `yarn`.
- `test` — unit tests
- `test-e2e` — integration tests for `esy`
- `test-opam` — "OPAM top 100 packages" test suite
- `linux-build` — Docker based macOS to Linux cross compilation infra

## Workflow

To make changes to `esy` and test them locally:

```
% git clone git://github.com/esy/esy.git
% cd esy
% make bootstrap
```

Run:

```
% make
```

to see the description of development workflow.

### Running Tests

```
% make test
```

### Branches

There are two branches:

- `master` — the active development, we cut new versions out of there regularly.
- `0.0.x` — maintainance branch for 0.0.x releases.

### Issues

Issues are tracked at [esy/esy][].

### Publishing Releases

esy is released on npm.

Because esy is written in OCaml/Reason and compiled into a native executable we
need to acquire a set of prebuilt binaries. We employ CI servers (thanks Travis
CI) to build platform specific releases.

The release workflow is the following:

1. Ensure you arre on `master` branch and run

   ```
   % make bump-patch-verson
   % git push && git push --tags
   ```

   (this bumps patch version, use `bump-minor-version` or `bump-major-version`
   correspondingly to bump either minor or major version of esy)

2. Wait till CI finishes its task and uploads releases on GitHub,
   check https://github.com/esy/esy/releases for them.

3. Run

   ```
   % make release
   ```
   Which downloads platform specific releases (which CI uploaded GitHub) and
   produces an npm releases with needed metadata inside `_release` directory.

4. Ensure release inside `_release` directory is ok.

   You can `cd _release && npm pack && npm install -g ./esy-*.tgz` to test how
   release installs and feels.

5. Run `cd _release && npm publish` to publish release on npm.

   Release tag `next` is used to publish preview releases.
