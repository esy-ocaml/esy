# esy

`package.json` workflow for native development with Reason/OCaml.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/esy-dev/esy/_apis/build/status/build)](https://dev.azure.com/esy-dev/esy/_build/latest?definitionId=1)

This README serves as a development documentation for esy. For user
documentation refer to [esy.sh][] documentation site.

## Workflow

To start hacking on esy:

```
% git clone git://github.com/esy/esy.git
% cd esy
% esy
```

To test esy in development you can use `./esy` wrapper which runs the `esy`
command.

On Linux/macOS (soon on Windows too) you can run:

```
% make install-githooks
```

which will install git hooks which will do pre commit validation.

### Updating `bin/esyInstallRelease.js`

`bin/esyInstallRelease.js` is developed separately within the `esy-install-npm-release/` directory.

Run:

```
% make bin/esyInstallRelease.js
```

to update the `bin/esyInstallRelease.js` file with the latest changed, don't
forget to commit it.

### Running Tests

Unit tests:

```
% esy test:unit
```

E2E tests:

```
% esy test:e2e
```

### Branches

There are two branches:

- `master` ‚Äî the active development, we cut new versions out of there regularly.
- `0.0.x` ‚Äî maintainance branch for 0.0.x releases.
- `0.2.x` ‚Äî maintainance branch for 0.2.x releases.
- `0.3.x` ‚Äî maintainance branch for 0.3.x releases.

## Workflow for esy.sh

To make changes to [esy.sh][]:

1. Bootstrap site's dev environment:

  ```
  % make site-bootstrap
  ```

2. Run site locally:

  ```
  % make site-start
  ```

3. When you are happy with the changes:

  ```
  % make site-publish
  ```

## Issues

Issues are tracked at [esy/esy][].

## Publishing Releases

esy is released on npm.

Because esy is written in OCaml/Reason and compiled into a native executable we
need to acquire a set of prebuilt binaries for each supported platform (Windows,
macOS and Linux). We employ CI servers (thanks Azure) to build platform specific
releases.

The release workflow is the following:

1.  Ensure you are on `master` branch and assuming you want to release the
    version currently defined in `package.json` (see step 6.), run

    ```
    % make release-tag
    % git push && git push --tags
    ```

2.  Wait till CI finishes its task and release `@esy-nightly/esy` package.

    You can test it manually.

3.  Run

    ```
    % make release-prepare
    ```

    which downloads the nightly corresponding to the current commit working
    directory is at and "promotes" it to a release. It will create
    `_release/package` directory.

4.  Ensure release inside `_release/package` directory is ok.

    You can `cd _release/package && npm pack && npm install -g ./esy-*.tgz` to test how
    release installs and feels.

5.  Run

    ```
    % make release-publish
    ```

    to upload the release on npm.

    Use

    ```
    % make NPM_RELEASE_TAG=next release-publish
    ```

    to publish the release under `next` tag (so users won't get it automatically but
    only explicitly requested).

6.  Bump version in `package.json` to the next patch version.

    We expect the next version to be mostly a patch version. In case you
    want to release new minor or major version you need to bump it before the
    release.
